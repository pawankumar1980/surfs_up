## Overview

The project explores the use of Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval to efficiently produce an analysis of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically, summary statistics of temperature data were used for June and December to determine if a prospective surf and ice cream shop business can sustainably operate year-round as opposed to a seasonal business.

## Results

 - During this period, June and December had average temperatures of 75°F and 71°F, respectively. June had a low temperature of 64°F and a high temperature of 85°F whereas December had a low temperature of 56°F and a high temperature of 83°F.
 
 - The standard deviation for June and December are 3.25 and 3.75; respectively, these values indicate that their temperature records are concentrated around both of their average temperatures.
 
 ## Summary of Findings
 
 In addition to temperature, we can further analyze

 - The precipitation data during June and December and see whether it plays a deciding factor. 

 -  The elevation at different locations in Oahu and the correlation with the business prospect at that location. The same can be used as a criterion for  choosing the location.
